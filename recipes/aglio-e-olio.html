        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the spaghetti.</b> Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.</li>
            <li><b>Sauté the garlic.</b>  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.</li>
            <li><b>Toss the pasta in the sauce.</b>  Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
            <li><b>Taste and season.</b> Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.</li>
            <li><b>Serve.</b> Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.
